# Forest
This a forest simulation. Multiple animals are enabled, which move around the forest in specific patterns and when two animals intercept each other, it results in a combat situation where only one animal survives.

Currently working to build a GUI on top of this, to sort of animate the animals, and to automate movement and attacking.
